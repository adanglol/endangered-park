    "<p>Papasula abbotti, or Abbottâ€™s booby, is an endangered seabird that breed only in a few spots on the Australian territory of Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean, although it formerly had a much wider range. The bird forages around Christmas Island, often around nutrient-rich oceanic upwellings. This bird has unique blue-colored webbed feet. Males have pale grey bills with a black tip, whereas females have pink bills with a black tip. There are various cause of decreasing population, including but not limited to its former habitats logged to make way for phosphate mining; introduction of yellow crazy ants, which decreased habitat quality. </p>");
